This script demonstrates how to use the SOMBA_tau and SOMBA_tau_meta functions 
defined for the soil based mass balance approach to quantifying the dissolution
fraction / mass transport coefficient in EW field trials (see Suhrhoff et al. 
2025).

The script has two main parts:
    1.  Data is loaded from a csv file. 
    2.  SOMBA_tau and SOMBA_tau_meta are called based on the input data frame.  
        If users use their own data they may need to adjust the column names to
        reflect the naming convention of their input data.


Please note that even if the code gives a sensible dissolution fraction, it 
does not necessarily mean that results are statistically significant or 
even physical - in addition to the analysis here, users should plot the data to
visually inspect that data falls within the domain of the mixing model or
otherwise make sure that all endmemer contributions are positive. In addition,
users have to perform statistical analyses considering all sources of 
uncertainties (e.g., using Monte Carlo simulations) to investigate whether the 
signal is robust statistically. Furthermore, due to the non-self-averaging
behavior, dissolution fractions should always be calculated from sample 
population means. Calculating dissolution fractions for individual samples and
then taking their average will not give the same result and will often be 
inaccurate, particularly when some samples fall outside of the mixing triangle. 
See Suhrhoff et al. (2025) for more detail.
